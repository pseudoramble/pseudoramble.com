========================

This is the creation of my new site and blog and whatnot. Here I'll host the entries and some of the tooling I use to create and maintain this site.

No, I don't accept pull requests here :)

TODO
-------------------------
  * Fix the header to actually link back to the index.
  * [DONE] Add a better description to the index.
      * "Featured Items"
      * Social Media/Contact buttons?
  * Add in some special handling of the /blog route.
      * Would like to have it so that it shows the most recent entry.
      * This would fix the header in the "about" page for example.
      * One potential fix - create an index file that just includes a copy of the newest material.
      * Another potential fix - Update the web server to redirect to newest entry.
  * Add in more "official" resume (PDF or otherwise).
  * Convert blog to use the assets/site.css stylesheet (it currently uses its own copy).
  * Convert whole site to use Sass or something else.
  * Setup Google Analytics.
