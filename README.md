========================

This is the creation of my new site and blog and whatnot. Here I'll host the entries and some of the tooling I use to create and maintain this site.

No, I don't accept pull requests here. :)

TODO
-------------------------

* Fix the header to actually link back to the index.
* [DONE] Add a better description to the index.
  * "Featured Items"
  * Social Media/Contact buttons?
* Add in more "official" resume (PDF or otherwise).
* Convert blog to use the assets/site.css stylesheet (it currently uses its own copy).
* Convert whole site to use Sass or something else.
