      How I Run This Blog
     </span>
     As I write this, I'm currently creating the code to operate this blog. These are essentially my notes, a new entry, and a neat outline of things I'm creating.
    </p>
    <p>
     This blog has a few simple strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      None of this content needs to be dynamically generated at run-time
     </li>
     <li>
      Almost none of this content needs JS
     </li>
     <li>
      I want to be able to start writing, previewing, publishing, and sharing new entries without much thought
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     With that in mind, my system is fairly simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emacs - Issue commands to do work. The place I'm usually working
     </li>
     <li>
      Python - BeautifulSoup 4 is great!
     </li>
     <li>
      Markdown - Neater to use during writing &amp; easy to export to HTML.
     </li>
     <li>
      Apache - Simple, tried, and true.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     My Emacs code consists of a few small functions -
     <em>
      'blog-new-entry
     </em>
     <em>
      'blog-generate-entry
     </em>
     <em>
      'blog-publish-entry
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      'blog-socialize-entry
     </em>
     . They essentially map to the commads outlined above.
    </p>
    <h3>
     'blog-new-entry
    </h3>
    <p>
     'blog-new-entry* visits a new file, given the name of the filename to use. It then switches the current window to the newly created buffer, and sets it as the current buffer. It does not save the current buffer by default.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      I write my filenames in-this-form.
     </li>
     <li>
      The directory where entries are stored is under the
      <em>
       blog-entry-dir
      </em>
      binding.
     </li>
     <li>
      The filetype used for new entries is stored under the
      <em>
       blog-file-type
      </em>
      binding.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <em>
      Example
     </em>
     : Suppose then I did the following:
     <code>
      M-x blog-new-entry &lt;RET&gt; test-entry
     </code>
     . I have
     <em>
      blog-file-type
     </em>
     set to ".md" and
     <em>
      blog-entry-dir
     </em>
     set to
     <code>
      ~/blog/entries/
     </code>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The created entry would look something like
     <code>
      ~/blog/entries/test-entry.md
     </code>
     . Once you're ready, save the buffer and then use
     <em>
      `blog-generate-entry
     </em>
     to continue on.
    </p>
    <h3>
     'blog-generate-entry
    </h3>
    <p>
     Some stuff about generating a new blog entry.
