     Ever begin working on a set of code to get something working, only to realize that you can't make forward progress? That was me, while working on a
     <a href="https://github.com/pseudoramble/listen-to-railroad-earth">
      side project
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     See, my component named
     <code>
      Player
     </code>
     was trying to be quite smart.
     <a href="https://github.com/pseudoramble/listen-to-railroad-earth/blob/67a822908ab79c1be7e94772b98a43d710497a3b/src/client/app/components/Player/Player.jsx">
      You can see the original version of the file here
     </a>
     .
     <code>
      Player
     </code>
     was supposed to have the following features:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Showed the typical HTML5 audio controls.
     </li>
     <li>
      The player would show the currently playing track
     </li>
     <li>
      Had the ability to go to the previous &amp; next tracks in a playlist.
     </li>
     <li>
      If the player was left running, it would continue through the existing playlist.
     </li>
     <li>
      If a new playlist was selected, it would reload with said playlist and begin playing that instead.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     As you can see and probably imagine,
     <code>
      Player
     </code>
     was trying to be way too smart for everyone's good:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      There was messy state to maintain.
     </li>
     <li>
      There were edge cases to be detected and dealt with.
     </li>
     <li>
      This component had no real sense of separation of concerns (code should serve one small set of purposes).
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     <a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">
      React + Flux
     </a>
     are put together to organize this setup so you avoid the situation I ended up in. Using a Flux architecture, you tend to force most data manipulating &amp; related logic in Stores. This leaves React components to typically be more simplified, and focused on rendering said data.
    </p>
    <p>
     The refactor looked like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      I modified the
      <code>
       Player
      </code>
      component to move all state-management into a Store.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Store and the
      <code>
       Player
      </code>
      component are then connected via an Action Creator and a Dispatcher.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Store then emits an event which the root component (
      <code>
       App
      </code>
      in this case) is looking for.
     </li>
     <li>
      <code>
       App
      </code>
      updates its state as needed.
     </li>
     <li>
      Finally, all subcomponents of
      <code>
       App
      </code>
      are updated (via
      <code>
       render()
      </code>
      ) using only
      <code>
       props
      </code>
      .
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     A more visual sketch of the refactor might look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>*User clicks next track*                                                              |-&gt; (Reconfig setlist)
----------------                    ------------------                                -------------
|              |  onTrackFinished   |                | {actionType : TRACK_FINISHED}  |           |
| Player (jsx) | -----------------&gt; | PlayerActions  | -----------------------------&gt; | ShowStore | ----------
|              |                    |                |     (Via the Dispatcher!)      |           |          |
----------------                    ------------------                                -------------          |
^                                                                                                            |
|____________________________________________________________________________________________________________|
   (Emit an event to have the "root" component of the application update its state. Send props to Player.)
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Once I had this realization, implementing new features (like previous/next, continuous playing of a setlist) became much more simplified. Keeping your concerns separated and only loosly connected really does work, to a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      In closing, I'll leave you with a few clues that you may need to refactor your React component(s):
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      You use
      <code>
       setState()
      </code>
      like a boss and you're not quite sure why.
     </li>
     <li>
      There are a bunch of edge cases to handle in a component.
     </li>
     <li>
      You're playing bug whack-a-mole (you fix one bug, only to create two more) in a component.
     </li>
     <li>
      A component is doing lots of data manipulation.
     </li>
     <li>
      Basic functionality seems to be impossible to enhance.
     </li>
    </ol>
