          Consider Using Collection Functions
        </div>
        I thought these functions were well known. I see them used incorrectly in code I read, which I found sorta surprising. I encourage folks to look into the collection utilities their language provides.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Here's a pretty typical example (Javascript):<br /><br />
           <pre><code data-language="javascript">var alphabet = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
var capitalized = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; alphabet.length; i++) {
  var upperCaseLetter = alphabet[i].toUpperCase();
  capitalized.push(upperCaseLetter);
}
console.warn(capitalized);</code></pre>
           This takes each element in the array, assumes a function called toUpperCase() exists on each element in the array, and pushes the value into a new array.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There's anything wrong with this (in the what &amp; how it's doing it sense; I could've made a mistake) but there is a nicer way to generate this using Javascript:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <pre><code data-language="javascript">var alphabet = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
var capitalized = alphabet.map(function(letter) {
  return letter.toUpperCase();
});
console.warn(capitalized);</code></pre>
           <span style="font-family: monospace">
             map()
           </span>
           takes a function as its argument, which is used to generate new values.
           <span style="font-family: monospace">
             map()
           </span>
           then iterates across each element in the list, executes the given function, and adds the returned value into a new array.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In other words, it does what the first snippet did before, but gets rid of the manual tracking and tediousness for you. Great right?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When using these functions, you've gotta make a concerted effort to dump your old habits. They do
           <i>
             sort of
           </i>
           look like typical loops in some cases. Here's a this-works-but-is-completely-missing-the-point example using the
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             some()
           </span>
           function:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <pre><code data-language="javascript">var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
var hasBigNumbers = false;
numbers.some(function(number) {
  var result = number &gt; 9;
  if (result) {
    hasBigNumbers = result;
    return true;
  }
});
console.warn(hasBigNumbers);</code></pre>
           The intent of
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             some()
           </span>
           is to find out if
           <i>
             any
           </i>
           element in a collection can be evaulated to true. The result of some is a boolean indicating whether the predicate was true for one or 
           more values within the collection. Its usage above tries to use it like a short-circuiting loop. While it exhibits this behavior, it's only by coincidence. It could be implemented other ways and still be correct.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A better way to use
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             some()
           </span>
           may look like this:<br /><br />
           <pre><code data-language="javascript">var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
var hasBigNumbers = numbers.some(function(number) {
  return number &gt; 9;
});
console.warn(hasBigNumbers);</code></pre>
           This has the same effect as the first version with
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             some()
           </span>
           but in a lot less words, and a lot less mechanics.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           One handy thing is you can chain these kinds of calls together in some scenarios. Here's a modified example of some code I was working on a while back for part of this site:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <pre><code data-language="javascript">var entries = lookup_entries();
var matching_entries = entries.map(function(entry) {
  return {
    title : entry.title,
    score : determine_score(entry);
  };
}).filter(function(entry) {
  return entry.score &gt; 0;
});</code></pre>
           Once again we see
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             map()
           </span>
           in action, but we also see another function
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             filter()
           </span>
           .
           <span style="font-family:monospace">
             filter()
           </span>
           takes each element, and determines if it should be "accepted" (the function evaulates to true) or "rejected" (the function evaluates to false). The net result of filter is a new array where all of the "accepted" values are held, but the "rejected" ones are not.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I sorta like how it looks. It seems like others don't. I dunno - whatever floats your boat.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           More importantly, it seems like others want to use them but are using them incorrectly. I think you should use them without a doubt. If you are though, try and use them correctly.
