     I am not fantastic at math. I've always found it interesting, but it's never come to me naturally. Sometimes it's good to face things you're not good at and give them a shot! So here we are, goofing off with prime numbers.
    </p>
    <h2>
     So first off, what is a prime number anyway?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Using a grade school explanation of it, prime numbers are natural numbers that can be evenly divided by two divisors - the number itself and 1.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few things:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      By natural number, I mean whole number (no decimals or complex numbers or crazy things) &gt; 0.
     </li>
     <li>
      By divisors, I mean a denominator. So in
      <code>
       10 / 2 = 5
      </code>
      , it would be 2.
     </li>
     <li>
      Those factors are the number itself (
      <code>
       n
      </code>
      lets say) and the number 1.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Okay, cool. So some number, itself, and 1. Got it.
    </p>
    <h2>
     What are some prime numbers?
    </h2>
    <p>
     A small sample would be
     <code>
      {2, 3, 5, 7}
     </code>
     .
    </p>
    <h2>
     How did you figure that out?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Let's first try out a real quick test for prime numbers between 1 and 10:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      &#10008; Trick question. One isn't considered a prime number.
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10004; That's our only option here!
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10004; We can skip
      <code>
       3 / 3
      </code>
      and
      <code>
       3 / 2 = 1.5
      </code>
      doesn't work. So count 3!
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10008;
      <code>
       4 / 2 = 2
      </code>
      so we can't count 4.
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10004;
      <code>
       5 / 4
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       5 / 3
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       5 / 2
      </code>
      don't give us whole numbers. So count 5!
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10008;
      <code>
       6 / 5
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       6 / 4
      </code>
      won't work.
      <code>
       6 / 3 = 2
      </code>
      so we can't count 6.
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10004;
      <code>
       7 / 6
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       7 / 5
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       7 / 4
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       7 / 3
      </code>
      |
      <code>
       7 / 2
      </code>
      don't give us whole numbers. So count 7!
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10008;
      <code>
       8 / 4 = 2
      </code>
      so we can't count 8.
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10008;
      <code>
       9 / 3 = 3
      </code>
      so we can't count 9.
     </li>
     <li>
      &#10008;
      <code>
       10 / 5 = 2
      </code>
      so we can't count 10.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Putting it together, you get the set
     <code>
      {2, 3, 5, 7}
     </code>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     You might notice a few things too:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      All of the even numbers are omitted (save for 2). So right away you knocked out 4, 6, 8, and 10.
     </li>
     <li>
      All of the numbers that are multiples of 3 were removed (save for 3). So you could eliminate 6 and 9.
     </li>
     <li>
      Even if we somehow missed that 10 / 2 = 5, we would catch that 10 / 5 = 2.
      <ul>
       <li>
        In other words, multiples of 5 disappear.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     You're finding
     <em>
      all numbers that are multiples of something else
     </em>
     . Once you've eliminated those numbers, you're left with the prime numbers! And that is the essence of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">
      Here's a handy illistration from Wikipedia
     </a>

    <h2>
     So how do I find the prime numbers under 123,456?!
    </h2>
    <p>
     Running this by hand (or most algorithms really) can be tedious. Good thing we've got these shiny fancy computer boxes now. They're even internet-enabled now!
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://github.com/pseudoramble/hundred-projects/blob/master/f%23/Numbers/sieve.fsx">
      An implementation of this I put together in F# can be found here
     </a>
     . The way I put together my implementation was probably not the most efficient, but I think is somewhat straight forward (here's a paired down form to show the idea):
    </p>
    <pre><code>let rec runTest multipliers limit removals =
    let multipler = List.head multipliers

    if multipler &gt; int (sqrt (float limit))
    then
        removals
    else
        let updatedRemovals = generateStep multipler limit removals
        runTest (List.tail multipliers) limit updatedRemovals

let n = 123456
let startSeq = seq { for i in 2 .. n -&gt; i }

runTest (List.ofSeq startSeq) n Set.empty
|&gt; Set.diffeernce (Set.ofSeq startSeq)
</code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A quick breakdown of the code above
     </strong>
     :
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      First, check if we need to calculate more primes by looking at the next multiplier.
      <ol>
       <li>
        If we do need to check, we generate the values from
        <code>
         multiplier^2
        </code>
        to the upper bound specified.
       </li>
       <li>
        We that set of values with the previously calculated value to omit (see
        <code>
         Set.union
        </code>
        ).
       </li>
       <li>
        Repeat from #1.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>
      Once here, all the composite numbers have been found.
      <ol>
       <li>
        These are removed from the range from 2 to the upper bound (see
        <code>
         Set.difference
        </code>
        ).
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>
      You are now left with only prime numbers!
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     So there you have it - A way to find prime numbers. In Part 2, we'll goof around more by talking about how prime numbers actually can make
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     other natural number.
