     I've come to enjoy coffee (regular
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     decaf) in my adult life. So do others in the US, apparently. According to the website CoffeeResearch.org,
     <a href="http://www.coffeeresearch.org/market/usa.htm">
      there were 108,000,000 (108 million) coffee drinkers
     </a>
     in the US. For context, the US population at that time was estimated
     <a href="http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/24_resident_population_by_age_and_state.html">
      to be around 272,690,813 (272 million) people
     </a>
     . In other words, roughly 40% of the US population drank coffee. That's a big cup of coffee to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Since so many of us spend so much time enjoying coffee, it seems like being confident we're consuming it in a cost efficient way would be useful. It made me wonder if:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      I can save money by making it myself.
     </li>
     <li>
      If I can save money, how much can I save?
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The gist of it is that I can certainly save if I avoid going out. In fact, it would cost me roughly half (50%) as much to make it at home instead of going out to a specific location to get my coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly,
     <a href="http://www.pseudoramble.com/pub/should_i_go_to_dunkin_donuts_today.ods">
      here's where I did the calculations
     </a>
     . Feel free to tinker with it and find any mistakes, or switch it to meet your needs. I tried to set it up so that the numbers could at least be changed in case other people see things differently.
    </p>
    <p>
     I made a few assumptions to help myself work these details out:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      I used Dunkin Donuts since that's where I often will end up.
     </li>
     <li>
      DD grounds from a store will give me equivalent quality to a store-made coffee.
     </li>
     <li>
      I'm buying a medium hot coffee from DD (which comes out to 14 fl.oz)
     </li>
     <li>
      I drink one coffee per working day (5 days of a week) and I work 50 weeks of the year.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     With that in mind, let's answer some questions:
    </p>
    <h2>
     How much does it cost me to buy my coffee in store?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Using the above assumptions and the estimated market price of a medium coffee near me ($2.29), it's about $572.50 a year.
    </p>
    <h2>
     How much does it cost me to make my coffee at home?
    </h2>
    <p>
     This involves answering a few smaller questions:
    </p>
    <h3>
     How much coffee is required to make a medium coffee at home?
    </h3>
    <p>
     The packaging on a bag of grounds from DD and many other coffee makes suggests roughly 1.5 "scoops" to every 6 fl. oz of water. The packaging also claims that for 12 oz of coffee grounds, one can make 40 cups of coffee (using the info they provide).
    </p>
    <p>
     To make an equivalent to the hot medium coffee from DD, we'd need about
     <em>
      3.5 "scoops"
     </em>
     . I derived this by using the ratio of a medium hot coffee to the suggested 6 fl. oz they suggest, and then multiplying it by the suggested amount of scoops for each 6 fl. oz.
    </p>
    <h3>
     How many medium coffees can I make with one bag of coffee?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Using the information from the section above, there are roughly
     <em>
      17 medium coffees in one 12 oz bag of grounds
     </em>
     . There are roughly 60 "scoops" in a bag of grounds (
     <code>
      40 cup/bag * 1.5 scoops/cup = 60 scoops/bag
     </code>
     ). And since we need about 3.5 scoops to make a medium coffee, we end up with 17 medium coffees from a bag of this coffee (
     <code>
      60 scoops/bag / 3.5 scoops/cup = 17 cup/bag
     </code>
     ).
    </p>
    <h3>
     So, how much?
    </h3>
    <p>
     We would need about 15 bags of grounds to survive the year on this system (
     <code>
      250 cup/year / 17 cups/bag = ~15 bag/year
     </code>
     ). Assuming a price of grounds costs about $9.00 (a very rough guess), you get about $135 in grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course I'm fancy too and enjoy half-and-half. Assuming I'm an animal and drink a quart of half and half each week, that's 50 containers a year. That comes out to around $125 a year.
    </p>
    <p>
     So,
     <strong>
      my total yearly cost for making my own coffee would be ~$260.
     </strong>
     This is around half the amount it would cost me to buy it in the store.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Are you sure this is realistic?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Of course I could be off base. But I think I've exaggerated the numbers enough to ensure that I compensate for losses here or there. It would be really interesting to try and come up with experiments or data sets to see if what I'm saying is accurate. YMMV.
