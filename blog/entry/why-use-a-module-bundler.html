     Trying to learn a new set of tools is a daunting task. There's a lot of moving parts to a fancy setup, especially with module bundlers like Webpack. Grabbing a boilerplate is easy, but also confusing if something doesn't work.
     <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-makes-you-sad">
      React may even make you sad
     </a>
     after trying it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     I decided I had to go back and look again. Why do I even want Webpack (or Browserify, or Rollup)?
    </p>
    <p>
     I wanted to run a modern-ish setup with the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      ES6 features including modules (Babel)
     </li>
     <li>
      npm packages
     </li>
     <li>
      Avoid a moduler bundler as long as I could
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     So I started off with a new project. Typical
     <code>
      npm init
     </code>
     and
     <code>
      git init
     </code>
     kind of stuff. Then for a few packages:
    </p>
    <pre><code>npm install babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Okay, cool. Babel + some preset plugins. So now how do we use Babel?
     <code>
      babel-cli
     </code>
     helps us there. It could allow you to configure a compilation step in your
     <code>
      package.json
     </code>
     maybe like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code data-language="javascript">...
"scripts": {
    "compile": "babel src/ --out-file dist/app.js"
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Now
     <code>
      npm run compile
     </code>
     will create a newly compiled-and-concatenated JS file. With a
     <code>
      .babelrc
     </code>
     file created and
     <code>
      babel-preset-*
     </code>
     installed, I thought I was all settled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, kinda. Here's the output of this on a single file written in ES6 using React:
    </p>
    <pre><code data-language="javascript">import React from 'react';
import X from './x.jsx';

export default (function (_ref) {
  var moves = _ref.moves;

  var eachStep = moves.length &gt; 0 ? moves.map(function (action, i) {
    return React.createElement(
      "div",
      { key: i },
      (action.player === "user" ? "You" : "The computer") + " removed " + action.move + " sticks"
      );
    }) : [React.createElement(
      "div",
      null,
      "Begin when you're ready!"
  )];

  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    { style: { "margin-top": "15px" } },
    eachStep
  );
});
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Problems galore!
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      There's this mystical
      <code>
       react
      </code>
      module we don't know about.
     </li>
     <li>
      Speaking of which, why am I still importing the local module
      <code>
       X
      </code>
      ?
     </li>
     <li>
      Speaking of which, modules shouldn't be showing up anymore! This won't load in a browser at all!
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Some of these things are Babel plugins,
     <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/">
      which you can find here
     </a>
     . Which is cool.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of these things can't be done with Babel alone. Like
     <code>
      npm
     </code>
     modules. It won't be aware of them, or define them as globals for you (AFAIK there isn't a plugin to do this). So you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Include the globals you need in your
      <code>
       index.html
      </code>
      header
     </li>
     <li>
      Attach modules to the
      <code>
       window
      </code>
      object where needed
     </li>
     <li>
      Run a module bundler, which supports these things (and more) through plugins
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     So yeah, module bundlers are helpful in larger setups, even with a bit of a learning curve/some headaches.
    </p>
    <p>
     I highly recommend just trying to start from scratch and work your way through the setup of a module bundler. No boilerplates, and no copying configs from elsewhere.
